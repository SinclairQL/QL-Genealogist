# QL-Genealogist
Family Tree Program for Sinclair QL in compiled SuperBASIC and 68000 Machine Code

This former commercial program was originally written by Chris Boutal and later sold with some updates by Rich Mellor through 
RWAP Software (www.rwapsoftware.co.uk)

As part of the 30th Anniversary Celebrations of RWAP Software, it has now been released as freeware, complete with all sources to
to the code and toolkits used within the code.

The compiled files are stored in a format for use with the QL emulator, Q-emuLator and you need 1920K memory to run the program.

Chris Boutal continues to develop and sell family tree programs - now morphed into the Genealogy Research System -
