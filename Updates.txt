                 QL GENEALOGIST VERSION 3 (POINTER VERSION)
                 ------------------------------------------

 UPDATES SINCE V3.20:

 V3.21
 -----
 - ReLoad now clears out an existing database completely.
 - The program now copes with sub-directories properly.
 - There is no longer an error (or crash) if you try to Quit when choosing the
   sex of the first person to be entered in a new database.
 - If a county file is not included in your current database, this no longer
   crashes the program when selected from the Research Reports Menu.
 - Manual improved
 - If you try to use PICK when there are no names in the database to select
   from, any that you have already typed are not lost.
 - There are no longer any problems if you enter several sons and daughters for
   the same person (highlighting the father's name before adding each child).
 - A major problem with entering notes from the Research Menu when a selected
   person did not already have any notes has been overcome.
 - It is now easier to enter numbers (display tidied up)
 - The year for a date must be at least 100A.D.  Any two digit year is added to
   the current century eg. a date of 1/1/99 becomes 1/1/1999 (presuming that we
   are all still in the 20th Century!).  Year 2000 compatible.
 - The Update Notes menu, no longer crashes if you delete an item.  The
   deleted item is also now shown as unavailable (in red ink).
 - Verify now warns you if a male person has been listed as someone's mother (or
   a female person listed as someone's father)
 - Verify now warns you if two people of the same sex are shown as spouses!
 - Create EVENT now warns you if the changes to a research segment have not
   been saved before you try to use this option.

 v3.22
 -----
 - Files converted from earlier versions could sometimes give an error.  This
   has now been rectified.
 - The program now ensures that christian names are entered with the first
   letter in capitals, the rest in lower case.
 - The lines joining generations are now displayed once again in the Network
   view.
 - If you reLoad a database, there is now a warning screen and you are told if
   you have any unsaved edits.  Also cancel from the file selection screen no
   longer leaves the program unless you cancel this menu when the program is
   first run.
 - You can now enter the details of mother and father for a spouse if you wish
   (this means you can keep track of two families together).  In the past, this
   seems to have worked provided that the couple had children.
 - This change has also meant that a woman can have more than one husband
   without children as well.
 - The screen dealing with changing a person's details has now been tidied up -
   there could be confusion over husband / wife.
 - The program is now better at dealing with deleted entries.
 - You can now move all of the windows without getting a bad parameter error.

 v3.23
 -----
 - Slight modification to the boot program

 v3.24
 -----
 - For some reason v3.22 and v3.23 did not load all databases giving out of heap
   space and other errors.  This is now fixed.
 - Names which do not start with a letter no longer crash the program.
 - Changed program so that space within name tables is used up as much as possible
 - Spouses who have both been married more than once no longer causes a problem
 - Old databases are now updated on loading to ensure all spouses have a link.

 v3.25
 -----
 - The TREE no longer misses the joining lines from some couples and joining
   lines are correctly depicted for couples with no children
 - A few bugs eradicated which could make the program report an error whilst
   generating a TREE.
 - Some System Names were still appearing on the print out.
 - You can now pass the name of a network to load (useful for FileInfo II).
   - use the filename which ends in _net for this to work (preceded by '\' if
   you also want to set the display size).
   This now gives the following options:

   EXEC_W flp1_g3_obj;'flp2_ROYAL_net'  (Load the ROYAL family tree)

   EXEC_W flp1_g3_obj;'800x600'         (Use 800x600 display mode)

   EXEC_W flp1_g3_obj;'800x600\flp2_ROYAL_net' (use 800x600 display mode and
                                                load ROYAL family tree)

 - The program no longer 'loses' children if you have inadvertantly given
   somone the wrong parent and then join them to the correct parent.
 - Further tests are now carried out when you try to Join 2 people :
   1) if they have already been specified as having different parents, you
      cannot join two people as siblings!
   2) you cannot join together two people with the same sex as spouses.
 - If you have QMenu on your system, this is used to help you to select the
   name of the family tree to be loaded.
 - It is now harder to create a person with no name at all! Any which already
   exist in the database are deleted during the loading process.
 - You can no longer Go To a deleted person or System Name.
 - The Index command now allows you to print a list of persons in the database
   either alphabetically, or by Network ID number.
 - When you Generate a Tree, all existing T markers are removed - only those
   people who appeared on the latest tree will now have a T marker.
 - When you Verify the tree, all existing V markers are removed
 - Verify procedure improved - when two numbers are doubtful, both are marked
   with V and other minor changes.
 - You can now remove the markers from a Single person, or all persons in the
   tree
 - A new menu has been added to the Parameters - Options - Tolerences option.
   You can now specify:
   Search Year Tolerence    (this already existed and was the tolerence used if
                             you wanted to search for someone who was born/died
                             in a given year)
   Generation Gap Tolerence (used in Verify - if the age difference between
                             parent and child exceeds this, a warning is issued.
                             Also note that you are warned if a parent was below
                             16 when the child was born)
   Age Gap Tolerence        (used in Verify - if the age difference between
                             husband and wife exceeds this, a warning is given)
 - If you add a text note to a given person, you are now given the option to use
   FileInfo II to display the file associated with the text note (if FileInfo II
   is installed on your system).
 - Slight bug in Add Text / Add Image has been removed (could cause duplicates)
 - QMenu is now used (if present) to allow you to choose the text file/image to
   be linked to a Note for a person.
 - You can now use the Parameters - Printer - Codes option to add the necessary
   codes for your printer to control line spacing (Epson printers should use
   ESC + n (where n is the line spacing in n/360 inch units).  In decimal, this
   is 27,43,n
   You can change the value of 'n' at print time, from the Layout menu (also
   available via Parameters - Printer), selecting the Line Spacing option.
   Note that this presumes that your printer needs three characters to change
   line spacing.

   If not, simply enter the whole sequence via Parameters - Printer - Codes -
   Line Spacing and ensure that the Layout - Line Spacing value is set to zero.

 v3.26
 -----
 - Change now offers you sub-menus for a persons parents and spouse(s).  You can
   then amend the parents/spouse or remove them by setting their netword ID to
   zero.
 - Holes in the name tables are now filled up better.
 - Some problems with multiple spouses/parents on both sides rectified.
 - For some reason v3.25 could sometimes lock up when you tried to GO TO a
   system name - this is now rectified (we hope!)
 - Fixed a problem in previous versions which had problems where there was a
   relatively low Network ID which pointed to a System Name - this could
   prevent you adding any more names.
 - If a 'System Child' had '*DELETED*' as part of its name, it would be removed
   when the database was loaded, destroying the links between childless spouses!
 - Program will now warn you if the memory is less than 125K and try to save the
   data.  In the past, this could cause the program to freeze.
